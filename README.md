Mini challenge #8 "Guess It"
In this console project we will be creating a guessing game

Review: Madeline Gowan
The game works as intended, but I would say it is a little confusing in some ways. For example, it asks you to enter the numbers as well when choosing the difficulty. Also, if you enter something other than a number, the program immediately ends. It does state that the entry in invalid, but after that, it terminates. It might be more user-friendly were it to instead repeat the question, so you didn't have to start the program over again. However, it runs as it should.
